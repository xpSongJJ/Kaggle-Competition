    "Wait a minute!": 120,
    "The archivist had him locked up!": 121,

    "Ah, that's better!": 130,
    "An old shirt? Try the university.": 131,
    "Oh, that's from Bean Town.": 132,
    "She led marches and helped women get the right to vote!": 133,
    "Hmm. You could try the Aldo Leopold Wildlife Center.": 134,
    "Why don't you go talk to her? I'll let her know you're coming.": 135,
    "Wait a sec. Women couldn't vote?!": 136,
    "Your flag must have been part of a national movement!": 137,

    "Teddy's helping too.": 173,
    "She helped get votes for women!": 174,

    "It's true, they do keep going missing lately.": 176,
    "Wait a minute...": 177,
    "Hey, nice dog! What breed is he?": 178,

    "I bet the archivist could use this!": 180,
    "You did it! Thanks, kid.": 181,
    "It's a women's basketball jersey!": 182,
    "Besides, I already figured out the shirt.": 183,
    "Leopold, why don't you help me set up in the Capitol?": 184,
    "That settles it.": 185,
    "Wells, finish up your report.": 186,
    "Will do, Boss.": 187,
    "We need to talk about that missing paperwork.": 188,
    "Welcome back, Dear! How can I help you?": 189,
    "So? What'd you find out?": 190,
    "Go ahead, take a peek at the shirt!": 191,
    "It's OK, girl! Look, I found you a cricket!": 192,
    "This looks like a clue!": 193,
    "Wells! What was he doing here? I should ask the librarian.": 194,
    "Yes! It's the key for Teddy's cage!": 195,
    "That's it!": 196,
    "Our shirt is too old to be a basketball jersey!": 197,
    "I need to get to the Capitol and tell Gramps!": 198,
    "Hey! That's Governor Nelson in front of our flag!": 199,
    "I think he's in trouble!": 200,
    "That hoofprint doesn't match the flag!": 201,
    "But he never goes anywhere without his scarf!": 202,
    "Teddy's scarf! Somebody must've taken him!": 203,
    "Maybe he just got scared and ran off.": 204,
    "Nope, that's from Bean Town. I only drink Holdgers!": 205,
    "What happened here?!": 206,
    "I don't know!": 207,
    "Try not to panic, Jo.": 208,
    "Is this your coffee, Gramps?": 209,
    "It's a match!": 210,
    "Youmans was a suffragist!": 211,
    "We'll find him, Jo.": 212,
    "Check out the next artifact!": 213,
    "Want to look for more clues?": 214,
    "What is it?": 215,
    "Wait! Can't I do it?": 216,
    "We'll need a key card.": 217,
    "Alright, Jolie. Back to work.": 218,
    "Come on, let's get out of here!": 219,
    "I've got Wells's ID!": 220,
    "Gramps must be up in the collection room.": 221,
    "Hey, look at those scratches!": 222,
    "Why isn't the button working?": 223,
    "Make sure to get some old photos for the exhibit, like last time!": 224,
    "Jo!": 225,
    "Teddy, here I come!": 226,
    "I had one, but Teddy chewed it up.": 227,
    "And you, Frank-": 228,
    "I captured a badger in our museum!": 229,
    "What are you doing down here?": 230,
    "Here's your scarf back!": 231,
    "Jolie- keep your badger under control, or he'll have to go.": 232,
    "The kidnapper probably took Teddy on the elevator!": 233,
    "Wells, you already have a job to do.": 234,
    "I'm putting you in charge of the flag case.": 235,
    "I found the key!": 236,
    "He's been eating my lunch every day this week!": 237,
    "Let's go find him!": 238,
    "What's going on here?": 239,
    "Thanks for coming, Boss.": 240,
    "It could be an early design for the Wisconsin state flag!": 241,
    "I told you!": 242,
    "Nonsense. I want live animals at the exhibit, not stuffed ones.": 243,
    "Ah, Jolie! I'm glad you're here.": 244,
    "The symbol on the flag looks sort of like a deer hoof.": 245,
    "I'm telling you, Boss. Taxidermy is the way to go!": 246,
    "People sure drink a lot of coffee around here.": 247,
    "I'll go look at everyone's pictures!": 248,
    "Oh! There was a staff directory in the entryway!": 249,
    "How can I find out whose glasses these are?": 250,
    "Whoever lost these glasses probably took Teddy!": 251,
    "Okay. Thanks anyway.": 252,
    "I haven't quite figured it out just yet...": 253,
    "My friend is a flag expert.": 254,
    "She should be able to help you out.": 255,
    "Badgers? No.": 256,
    "You haven't seen any badgers around here, have you?": 257,
    "I'll ride with you!": 258,
    "It's for the flag display!": 259,
    "Come on, Teddy.": 260,
    "Hmm. Let's see...": 261,
    "We still need to figure out that flag. Do you know anyone who could help?": 262,
    "This can't be right!": 263,
    "Gramps is in trouble for losing papers?": 264,
    "\\u00f0\\u0178\\u02dc\\u00ad": 265,
    "Ha! Good one.": 266,
    "Unless you're too busy horsing around.": 267,

    "Grab your notebook and come upstairs!": 280,
    "I love these photos of me and Teddy!": 281,
    "Not sure.": 282,

    "Hang tight, Teddy.": 284,
    "Just this old slip from 1916.": 285,
    "Hot Dog! I knew it!": 286,
    "Please let me know if you do. It's important!": 287,
    "Ooh, I like clues!": 288,
    "Don't worry, Gramps. I'll find Teddy!": 289,
    "Two missions, actually!": 290,

    "I have an idea.": 298,
    "He's wrong about old shirts and his name rhymes with \\smells\\...": 299,
    "Could be. But we need evidence.": 300,
    "Aha! Good catch, Jo.": 301,
    "Gadzooks! Poor critter.": 302,
    "And you are?": 303,
    "Fine. Let's investigate!": 304,
    "I don't have time for kids.": 305,
    "BUT WELLS STOLE TEDDY!": 306,
    "Can you help me-": 307,
    "Yup, that's him!": 308,
    "*cough cough*": 309,
    "Fine. Then I guess you don't want a real, live badger for the exhibit.": 310,
    "Hold your horses, Jo.": 311,
    "I think I can help with your animal problem.": 312,
    "Oh my!": 313,
    "Now if only I could read this thing. Blasted tiny letters...": 314,
    "Can you help me? I need to find the owner of this slip.": 315,
    "*grumble grumble*": 316,
    "Oh, I'm fine! Just a little hoarse.": 317,
    "Can you help-": 318,
    "Ha! What do you call a pony with a sore throat?": 319,
    "Ha! I don't need your help.": 320,
    "Yes!": 321,
    "*COUGH COUGH COUGH*": 322,
    "Calm down, kid. I haven't seen him.": 323,
    "Huh?": 324,
    "Knew what?": 325,
    "Ugh. I have to head over there and check out the animals.": 326,
    "A little horse!": 327,
    "Ha! You're funny.": 328,
    "Did you have a question or not?": 329,
    "I love it!": 330,
    "A real, live ferret!": 331,
    "I need to find Wells!!!": 332,
    "I got that one from my Gramps!": 333,
    "Great. Just great. Could this day get any worse?!": 334,
    "Hi! *cough*": 335,
    "FINE. That possum better not scratch my leather seats...": 336,
    "And this place is dirty, and itchy, and-": 337,
    "Well, Leopold here is always losing papers...": 338,
    "Ha. Told you so!": 339,
    "Just please, don't let your badger eat them!": 340,
    "Of course you do. You've got a rodent following you around.": 341,
    "A vexy-wha?": 342,
    "Teddy! I'm sure glad to see you.": 343,
    "Your teacher said you could help me for extra credit.": 344,
    "Can we hurry up, Gramps?": 345,
    "Then do it for me!": 346,
    "Whatever.": 347,
    "No way, Gramps. You're the best!": 348,
    "Guess so!": 349,
    "Actually, badgers aren't rodents-": 350,
    "I suppose historians are boring, too?": 351,
    "YOU?!": 352,
    "Your teacher said you missed 7 assignments in a row!": 353,
    "Hmmm. Don't forget about your homework.": 354,
    "I'm a historian, not a zookeeper!": 355,
    "Teddy and I were gonna go climb that huge tree out back!": 356,
    "Gah. I can't believe this.": 357,
    "Look at that! It's the bee's knees!": 358,
    "Yes!!! I'm saved!": 359,
    "\\u00f0\\u0178\\u2122\\u201e": 360,
    "You again! Don't let him hurt me!": 361,
    "What the-": 362,
    "I don't have time for this, Gramps.": 363,
    "Teddy is still missing!": 364,
    "It's okay, Gramps. I'll go by myself.": 365,
    "No he hasn't!": 366,
    "You stole Teddy! How could you?!": 367,
    "Let's follow those scratch marks!": 368,
    "I got here and the whole place was ransacked!": 369,
    "Let's go find Gramps!": 370,
    "Ooh... \\Ecology flag, by Ron Cobb.\\": 371,
    "I think it's a flag! Pretty spiffy, eh?": 372,
    "\\u00e2\\u009d\\u00a4\\u00ef\\u00b8\\u008f": 373,
    "Did you steal Gramps's paperwork too?!": 374,
    "GRRRRRRR": 375,
    "Great Scott, you're right!": 376,
    "\\u00f0\\u0178\\u02dc\\u009d": 377,
    "You can't just steal Jolie's pet. Don't you know badgers are protected animals?": 378,
    "Besides, he looks friendly to me.": 379,
    "Teddy! Did you really eat his lunch?": 380,
    "Wait- me?": 381,
    "I don't have time for this.": 382,
    "See?!": 383,
    "And my homework?!?!": 384,
    "GAH! And what is THAT doing out of its cage?!": 385,
    "That thing's a monster!": 386,
    "Wha?!": 387,
    "Can I come, Gramps?": 388,
    "Sure thing, Jo. Grab your notebook and come upstairs!": 389,
    "I get to go to Gramps's meeting!": 390,
    "I knew it!": 391,
    "See you later, Teddy.": 392,
    "Thanks.": 393,
    "Now I Just need to find all the cleaners from way back in 1916.": 394,
    "How can I help you?": 395,
    "Sorry, I'm too busy for kids right now.": 396,
    "I need to find the owner of this slip.": 397,
    "Please let me know if you do.": 398,
    "Poor badger.": 399,
    "Hi! How can I help you?": 400,
    "Good catch!": 401,
    "The boss is gonna love it!": 402,
    "Who are you?": 403,
    "Now if only I could read this thing.": 404,
    "Okay. I'll find Teddy!": 405,
    "Slow down, Jo.": 406,
    "I haven't seen him.": 407,
    "I have to head over there and check out the animals.": 408,
    "Teddy! I'm glad to see you.": 409,
    "You're right, Gramps. Let's investigate!": 410,
    "But what if Wells kidnapped Teddy?": 411,
    "Then we need evidence.": 412,
    "It must've been Wells.": 413,
    "He's always trying to get you in trouble, and he doesn't like animals!": 414,
    "Can you help me find Wells?": 415,
    "Can you help me? I need to find Wells!": 416,
    "Oh no. If I don't impress the boss soon,  I'm gonna get fired!": 417,
    "Okay. Thanks!": 418,
    "I can't believe this.": 419,
    "What's a vexillophile? ": 420,
    "Please? This is really important.": 421,
    "What a fascinating artifact!": 422,
    "Yes!!!": 423,
    "Are you sure? I know where you can find a real, live badger for the exhibit!": 424,
    "Not Leopold here. He's been losing papers lately.": 425,
    "See?": 426,
    "We're looking for some photos.": 427,
    "I think I might be able to help you.": 428,
    "No thanks. I don't need help from kids.": 429,
    "What are you doing here?": 430,
    "Can I take a closer look?": 431,
    "Wow, that's so cool, Gramps!": 432,
    "It's already all done!": 433,
    "I got here and the whole place was a mess!": 434,
    "\\Ecology flag, by Ron Cobb.\\": 435,
    "Hmmm. Shouldn't you be doing your homework?": 436,
    "Well, that's good enough for me.": 437,
    "Plus, my teacher said I could help you out for extra credit!": 438,
    "I think it's a flag! Pretty interesting, huh?": 439,
    "Oh no!": 440,
    "You're right, Jo!": 441,
    "And how did that badger get free?": 442,
    "You can't just steal Jolie's pet.": 443,
    "I need to take the artifact upstairs. Why don't you investigate those scratch marks?": 444,
    "It's really cool, Gramps. But I'm worried about Teddy.": 445,
    "He's still missing!": 446,
    "Let's go help Gramps!": 447,
    "Okay. I'll try.": 448,
    "What should we do next?": 449,
    "I'm here to rescue my friend!": 450,
    "Ugh...": 451,
    "This button never works!": 452,
    "Hmm. Button's still not working.": 453,
    "But I hear the museum's got one on the loose!": 454,
    "Yeah. Thanks anyway.": 455,
    "She's right outside.": 456,
    "Why don't you go talk to the boss?": 457,
    "Poor Gramps! I should make sure he's okay.": 458,
    "Gramps is the best historian ever!": 459,
    "Gramps is a great historian!": 460,
    "Head over to the Basketball Center.": 461,
    "Um... what did you want me to do again?": 462,
    "Can't believe I lost my reading glasses.": 463,
    "I don't need that right now.": 464,
    "You could try the archivist. Maybe he can help you find Wells!": 465,
    "Where should I go again?": 466,
    "Well, get on it. I'm counting on you and your gramps to figure this out!": 467,
    "Jolie! I was hoping you'd stop by. Any news on the shirt artifact?": 468,
    "So much cleaning to do...": 469,
    "Meetings are BORING!": 470,
    "Um, are you okay?": 471,
    "He's a badger!": 472,
    "Fine, fine. Let's see...": 473,
    "And we still need to figure out that flag!": 474,
    "Go find your grampa and get to work!": 475,
    "I need to find Wells right away!! Do you know where he is?": 476,
    "Actually, we're just here for some photos.": 477,
    "He's. A. Badger.": 478,
    "Well, I did SOME of those. I just couldn't find them!": 479,
    "No... because history is boring!": 480,
    "Did you do all of them?": 481,
    "Hooray, a boring old shirt.": 482,
    "Jo! I can't go with you. I need to take the artifact upstairs.": 483,
    "Head back to the museum. Your gramps is waiting for you.": 484,
    "The archivist said I should look in the stacks.": 485,
    "Check out the archives. They've got tons of old photos!": 486,
    "Ugh. Meetings are so boring.": 487,
    "Sure!": 488,

    "Come on, Teddy. Let's go help Gramps!": 493,
    "You're still here? I'm trying to work!": 494,
    "I've seen him eating homework and important papers, too.": 495,
    "He has??": 496,

    "I need to find Wells right away! Do you know where he is?": 498,
    "We're just looking for photos for the flag display.": 499,
    "Don't worry, he won't! (And he's a badger, by the way.)": 500,
    "A boring old shirt.": 501,
    "So? History is boring!": 502,
    "Can I ride with you?": 503,
    "Are you okay?": 504,
    "Don't worry, Teddy won't eat your lunch anymore!": 505,
    "I can't go with you. I need to take the artifact upstairs.": 506,
    "Yes, he has. I've seen him eating homework and important papers, too.": 507,
    "What?!": 508,
    "Head over to the university.": 509,
    "What are you waiting for? The Stacks are right outside the door.": 510,
    "Head upstairs and talk to the archivist. He might be able to help!": 511,
    "What should I do first?": 512,

    "Nice seeing you, Jolie!": 514,
    "I'm sure they'll be able to help.": 515,

    "Hopefully you can rustle up some clues!": 518,
    "Why don't you go play with your grampa?": 519,
    "It's such a nice fall day.": 520,
    "I should stay and look for clues!": 521,
    "Hopefully you can find some clues!": 522,
    "Why don't you go catch up with your grampa?": 523,
    "There should be some info about that symbol in my book.": 524,
    "Well? What are you still doing here?": 525,
    "I feel like I'm forgetting something.": 526,
    "Maybe there's a clue in this mess!": 527,
    "I should help Gramps clean.": 528,
    "What are you still doing here,  Jolie?": 529,
    "I'm sure you'll find Theodora in there somewhere!": 530,
    "Weren't you going to check out our microfiche?": 531,
    "Take a look!": 532,
    "Come on, kid. You're slowing me down.": 533,
    "Come on, kid. Let's go.": 534,
    "You better get to the capitol!": 535,
    "Theodora wearing the shirt!": 536,

    "Good luck!": 539,
    "I'll be in the collection room. Come find me when you're ready to check out the artifact.": 540,
    "I should go talk to Gramps!": 541,
    "We just have to keep our eyes open!": 542,
    "We'll find Teddy.": 543,
    "I should ask the librarian where to go next.": 544,

    "I should find out if she can help me!": 553,
    "Ooh, nice decorations!": 554,
    "Poor foxes!": 555,

    "Welcome back, Jolie. Did you figure out the shirt?": 563,
    "The exhibit opens tomorrow.": 564,
    "I should check that logbook to see who owned this slip...": 565,

    "Meet me back in my office and we'll get started!": 567,
    "Come on, Jo!": 568,
    "Did you figure out the shirt?": 569,
    "One step at a time, Jo.": 570,
    "And where's your grampa?": 571,
    "Sorry for the delay, Boss.": 572,
    "Who is Teddy?": 573,
    "Wells got in trouble for littering at the Wildlife Center.": 574,
    "AND I know who took Teddy!": 575,
    "Mrs. M, I think Wells kidnapped Teddy.": 576,
    "Leopold, can you run back to the museum?": 577,
    "Wells sabotaged Gramps!": 578,
    "Here I am!": 579,

    "Are you going home now? Tomorrow's the big day!": 581,
    "Thanks!": 582,
    "I hope you find your badger, kid.": 583,
    "Jo, meet me back at my office.": 584,
    "Sounds good, Boss.": 585,
    "Nice work on the shirt, Jolie!": 586,
    "And he messed up Gramps's office, too!": 587,
    "It'll be okay, Jo. We'll find Teddy!": 588,
    "Why don't you prove your case?": 589,
    "Easy, Jo.": 590,
    "I figured out that you kidnapped him!": 591,
    "Wells! Where's Teddy? Is he okay?": 592,
    "Sorry I'm late.": 593,
    "He needs our help!": 594,
